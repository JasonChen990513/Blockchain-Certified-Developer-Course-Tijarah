# Why blockchain need the auditing and compliance  
One of the significant benefits of blockchain technology is its immutability, that mean want to modify or tamper data in blockchain is nearly impossible.   

That also mean if there are any bug or vulnerabilities within the blockchain can have severe consequences. It may cause financial losses or security breaches.  

For instance, the blockchain store sensitive data, like personal information and financial record. If there are any bug or vulnerabilities in blockchain's security, it may cause exposure of that information, leading to identity theft, fraud, or other malicious activities.  

Same as the financial field. If the blockchain have bug and vulnerabilities,  it may result in financial losses for the parties involved. This can lead to reputational damage for the organization using the blockchain and loss of trust from customers or stakeholders.  

Therefore, conducting a blockchain audit is crucial for businesses and organizations to ensure that their blockchain systems are secure, reliable, and compliant with industry standards. A blockchain audit can identify potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the blockchain and provide recommendations for improvement, mitigating any potential risks.  


# What is Auditing and compliance in blockchain 
Blockchain auditing is the process to evaluating a blockchain's security, functionality, and compliance with industry standards. It will review of the blockchain design  architecture and code. Ensure no vulnerabilities or weaknesses.  

Blockchain audits are conducted by experienced auditors and specialized audit firms with expertise in blockchain technology. These auditors will use advanced tools and techniques to check the blockchain integrity and give the recommendation for improvement.   

Blockchain audits play a vital role to ensure that blockchain is trustworthy and secure for all parties involved.  

# How Blockchain Audits Work    
A blockchain audit typically involves reviewing the blockchain network's technical specifications, code used to build the network, and verifying that the data stored in the blockchain is accurate and complete. The audit also can testing the blockchain network's security like the access controls and encryption protocols, to check vulnerabilities and weaknesses.   
The audit process typically involves the following steps:  

Planning: The audit team will work with the organization to define the scope of the audit, including the blockchain's objectives, functions, and expected outcomes.  

Reviewing: The audit team will review the blockchain's architecture and code to assess its integrity.  

Testing: The audit team will perform various tests to identify any vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the blockchain's security, such as penetration testing, code review, or configuration review.  

Reporting: The audit team will provide a detailed report of their findings and recommendations for improvement. The report may include a summary of the audit's objectives, scope, methodology, and findings.  

Follow-up: The audit team may work with the organization to implement any recommendations and ensure that the blockchain system is functioning correctly.  

# Benefits of Blockchain Audits  
Improved Security: Conducting blockchain audit can identify the potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the blockchain system security. The organization can take corrective measures to mitigate any potential risks.  

Compliance with Industry Standards: A blockchain audit can ensure that the blockchain system complies with industry standards and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations.   
This is usually more of a concern with explicitly financial applications built on top of blockchains, but itâ€™s something to consider for baselayer builders too.  

Enhanced Trust and Credibility:  Conducting a blockchain audit to ensure the integrity and security of their blockchain systems. Enhancing trust and credibility among users and stakeholders.  

Cost Savings: Identifying the potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the blockchain system can let the organization avoid the potential financial losses, reputational damage, or legal liabilities.  

Continuous Improvement: A blockchain audit can provide organizations recommendation for improving the blockchain system to avoid the potential risks and facing challenges.  

# Different Types of Blockchain Audits  
There are two types of audits that are conducted on blockchain systems:   
## Audits of the underlying blockchain protocol   

An audit of the underlying blockchain protocol is done to evaluate the security, functionality, and compliance of the blockchain protocol itself. This type of audit makes sure that the blockchain is operating as intended and that there are no vulnerabilities or weaknesses.   
The audit team usually consists of experienced auditors who specialize in blockchain technology. They use advanced tools and techniques to assess the blockchain's integrity and provide recommendations for improvement.  

## Audits of the smart contracts   


An audit of the smart contracts that run on top of the blockchain protocol is done to evaluate the security, functionality, and compliance of the smart contracts that are used to execute transactions on the blockchain.   
An audit of the smart contracts ensures that they are operating as intended and that there are no vulnerabilities or weaknesses. The audit team usually consists of experienced auditors who specialize in smart contract development and security. They use specialized tools and techniques to assess the smart contract's integrity and provide recommendations for improvement.
