# What is Proof of Stake
Proof of stake(PoS) is the cryptocurrency consensus machanism, it is use to processing transaction and creating new block.  
Proof-of-stake (POS) was created as an alternative to proof-of-work (POW).  
PoS mechanisms require validators to hold and stake tokens for the privilege of earning transaction fees.  
Proof-of-stake (POS) is seen as less risky regarding the potential for an attack on the network, as it structures compensation in a way that makes an attack less advantageous.  (why? detail)
The next block writer on the blockchain is selected at random, with higher odds being assigned to nodes with larger stake positions.   


# How it Work?
Compare with PoW, PoS redduce the amount of computational work needed to verify the blocks and transaction.  
In PoS system validator need to offer their coin as collateral.  
The validator is chosen by the system randomly. Who can get the fee is decide by system, not like the PoW need to compete with other miner.  
If wnat to ba a validator, need to 'Stake' a specific amount of coins.   
One block is validate by multiple validator.   
Different proof-of-stake mechanisms may use various methods to reach a consensus.   


 
1. **Staking:** 
Participants in the network lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral by staking it in the network.  
2. **Validator Selection:**  
Validators are selected to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they have staked.  
The selection process aims to achieve a fair and decentralized distribution of the opportunity to create new blocks.  
3. **Block Creation and Validation:**  
The chosen validator creates a new block, which is then broadcast to the network.  
Other validators verify the validity of the proposed block.  
> Example:  
> In Ethereum introduces sharding, a validator will verify the transactions and add them to a shard block, which requires no more than 128 validators to form a voting "committee."  
> Once shards are validated and a block created, two-thirds of the validators must agree that the transaction is valid, then the block is closed.

4. **Consensus and Block Addition:**
If a consensus is reached that the proposed block is valid, it is added to the blockchain.  
Validators who participated in the consensus process are rewarded with cryptocurrency.  
5. **Stake Adjustment:**
The amount of cryptocurrency staked by participants may be adjusted dynamically based on network rules.  
Validators who engage in malicious behavior or fail to validate transactions accurately may face penalties, including the loss of staked funds.
