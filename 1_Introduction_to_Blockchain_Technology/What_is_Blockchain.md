    Blockchain
        base on peer to peer topology
        distributed ledger technology 
            that data can be store in globlely on thousands of server
            a platform that uses ledgers stored on separate, connected devices in a network to ensure data accuracy and security
        everyone can get the real time data
        one user is hard to gain control the network
        more secure and transparent


    Block-Chain
        Digital information (block) store in the public database(chain)


    Block have 3 part
        1.information about the transaction (date, time, transfer amount)
        2.information about participants
            not include any identifying, only digital signature
        3.information about other block
            the unique code call "hash" 
                cryptographic codes created by special algorithms

        a single block can store 1 MB for data
        blockchain is base on the transaction


        Question:
            But in reality, a single block in blockchain can store 1MB of data and that's why, depending on the size of the transaction, a single block can store a few thousand transactions under one roof.


    How the blockchain work
        For block to be added to Blockchain
            1.A transaction must occur
            2.That transaction must be verified
                miner will do the verify, check the transation, dollar amount and praticipant.
            3.The transaction must be stored in a block
                information include the praticipant digital signature transation dollar amount.
            4.That block must be given a hash
                hash is the unique code 



        Question: 
        4:54
            It is this hash ID which differentiates the processed transaction from the others and even a small space can make a huge difference in its identification. 
        


    Who & What is a Blockchain Miner
        Role of miner validate new transactions and record them on the global ledger and get the reward.
