    What is blockchain?

    Video name: What is Blockchain Technology and How Does it Work | Blockchain Explained in 6 minutes

    Blockchain
        Digital information (block) store in the public database(chain)
        Base on peer to peer topology
            2 PC communicate without the server, each user can be a server and node.

        Distributed ledger technology 
            That data can be store in globlely on thousands of server
            A platform that uses ledgers stored on separate, connected devices in a network to ensure data accuracy and security

        One user is hard to gain control the network
        More secure and transparent
        Unique id for each item
        It is immutable
            If want to change the data, a least need 2/3 nodes be modified. (for this chain)

        Good transparency of all transaction
        Everyone can get the real time data
        why blockchain speed faster than normal database? 
            For the blockchain stored the data in the node, when want to update the data in the node, only need to get the data which is inside your node. So the speed is depend on the size you need to download.


    Block have 3 part
        1.Information about the transaction (date, time, transfer amount)
        2.Information about participants
            not include any identifying, only digital signature
        3.Information about other block
            the unique code call "hash" 
                cryptographic codes created by special algorithms

        A single block can store 1 MB for data
        Blockchain is base on the transaction


        Question:
        2:39
            But in reality, a single block in blockchain can store 1MB of data and that's why, depending on the size of the transaction, a single block can store a few thousand transactions under one roof.

            Is the one block store one transaction detail or many?
                 one block innclude a lot of transaction and contract


    How the blockchain work
        For block to be added to Blockchain
            1.A transaction must occur
            2.That transaction must be verified
                miner will do the verify, check the transation, dollar amount and praticipant.
            3.The transaction must be stored in a block
                information include the praticipant digital signature transation dollar amount.
            4.That block must be given a hash
                hash is the unique code 
        After this 4 steps, the block can be add to the blockchain.


        Question: 
        4:54
            It is this hash ID which differentiates the processed transaction from the others and even a small space can make a huge difference in its identification. 

            what is the small space can make a huge difference in its identification?
        

    Who & What is a Blockchain Miner
        Role of miner validate new transactions and record them on the global ledger and get the reward.

        After the new block add to the blockchain, everyone can view it.

    




    

    The need for web3
        It provide more secure, private, transparnecy of transaction. And it is no need the intermediary.
