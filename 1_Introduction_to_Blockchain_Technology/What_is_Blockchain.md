# What is blockchain?




## Video name: What is Blockchain Technology and How Does it Work | Blockchain Explained in 6 minutes

Blockchain
Digital information (block) store in the public database(chain)  
Base on peer to peer topology  
> 2 PC communicate without the server, each user can be a server and node.

Distributed ledger technology  
> That data can be store in globlely on thousands of server  
> A platform that uses ledgers stored on separate, connected devices in a network to ensure data accuracy and security   

One user is hard to gain control the network  
More secure and transparent  
Unique id for each item  
> It is immutable  
>> If want to change the data, a least need 2/3 nodes be modified. (for this chain)  

Good transparency of all transaction  
Everyone can get the real time data  
why blockchain speed faster than normal database?   
> For the blockchain stored the data in the node, when want to update the data in the node, only need to get the data which is inside your node. So the speed is depend on the size you need to download.  


Block have 3 part
>1.Information about the transaction (date, time, transfer amount)  

>2.Information about participants  
>>not include any identifying, only digital signature  

>3.Information about other block  
>>the unique code call "hash"  
>>>cryptographic codes created by special algorithms  

A single block can store 1 MB for data  
Blockchain is base on the transaction  


Question: 2:39
>But in reality, a single block in blockchain can store 1MB of data and that's why, depending on the size of the transaction, a single block can store a few thousand transactions under one roof.  

>Is the one block store one transaction detail or many?
>>One block include a lot of transaction and contract internal transaction.(ETH block)


How the blockchain work  
For block to be added to Blockchain  
>1.A transaction must occur  

>2.That transaction must be verified   
>>Miner will do the verify, check the transation, dollar amount and praticipant.  

>3.The transaction must be stored in a block  
>>Information include the praticipant digital signature transation dollar amount.  

>4.That block must be given a hash  
>>hash is the unique code  

After this 4 steps, the block can be add to the blockchain.  


Question: 4:54
It is this hash ID which differentiates the processed transaction from the others and even a small space can make a huge difference in its identification.  
>what is the small space can make a huge difference in its identification?   
>>Because any change in the transaction data will be affect the hash generate.           

Who & What is a Blockchain Miner  
>Role of miner validate new transactions and record them on the global ledger and get the reward.  

After the new block add to the blockchain, everyone can view it.  

Question: last time say the miner would not be compete anymore, for now how to calculate the hash?  
pos  
poa  
pow  
pods  

    


## Video name: 7 Skills Needed to Become a Blockchain Developer | Blockchain Developer Career Path  


1. Command Line  
Learn Unix or Linux command-line interface.  
Learning how to interate with computer using command line.      

2. Javascript  
It supported by every browser.  
It is client side language and can performs the computation in web browser, no need to wait the server reply.  

3. NodeJS  
Cross-platform javascript.  
Enable developer to write server-side application with javascript.  
Many blockchain frameworks are built on top of NodeJS.  

4. Blockchain baiscs  
What is blockchain?  
>Block use to store the information in the chain(database).  

How does it work?  
>When the transaction occur, and the transaction is virified.   
>The transaction information will be store into the block.   
>The block will have unique hash and store in to blockchain.  
>After it will be add to the blockchain.  

What are the consensus mechanisms?  
>System that validates a transaction and marks it as authentic.  
>>EX: if the hash is different, the block will be replace by the currect one.  

What is a node?  
>It is computer systems that contain a copy of a blockchain's primary protocol and its entire transaction history.  
>>Lite node: specify a point in time and copy the data after that point in time.(Question: is my understanding correct?)   
>>archive  
>>full  

What is a Smart Contract?  
>It is Immutable.  
>it is digital contracts stored on a blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined terms and conditions are met.  

5. Solidity  
It is OOP language for write the Smart Contract.  

6. Web3.js  
Is a collection of libraries that allows user to interact with local or remote ethereum node using an http or ipc.   
Used to connect an ethereum blockchain to a client browser usually through a browser extension like metamask.  
Easily installed into javascript object and allows user decentralized application to run and retrieve information to and from a blockchain defined by the user.  

7. Turffle Suite
A framework which facilitates the development, testing and deployment of full-stack decentralised applications.  
Framework   
>Can write and deploy smart contract within minutes.  
>Easy to use solidity and javascript test the smart contract.  
>Easy deployment to any test network or the main network from the command line.  
Ganache  
>Allows you to start a local blockchain in your development environment with just two clicks and makes developing decentralized applications on your machine extremely easy.
