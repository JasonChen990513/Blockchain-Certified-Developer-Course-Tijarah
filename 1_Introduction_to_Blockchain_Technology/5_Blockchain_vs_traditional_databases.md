# Database vs BLockchain
|Database|Blockchain|
|:-------|:---------|
|Database uses centralized storage of data.|Blockchain uses decentralized storage of data.|
|Database needs a Database admin or Database administrator to manage the stored data.|There is no administrator in Blockchain.|
|Modifying data requires permission from database admin.|Modifying data does not require permission. 
Users have a copy of data and by modifying the copies does not affect the master copy of the data as Blockchain is irresistible to modification of data.|
|Centralized databases keep information that is up-to-date at a particular moment.|Blockchain keeps the present information as well as the past information that has been stored before.|
|Centralized databases are used as databases for a really long time and have a good performance record, but are slow for ertain functionalities.|Blockchain is ideal for transaction platform but it slows down when used as databases, specially with large collection of data.|
