# Database 
Database is a data structure use to store the information.
It can store data and also can access a existing data.
The data store in database can organized using a database management system.
Using the client-server architecture.
The database administrator can modify the data in database.

# Blockchain
It is a growing list record, call block, that are linked using cryptography.
The block contain the cryptograthic hash of the pervious block, timestamp and transaction data.
Data in block is immutable.
It is decentralized architecture.


# Database vs BLockchain
|Database|Blockchain|
|:-------|:---------|
|Database uses centralized storage of data.|Blockchain uses decentralized storage of data.|
|Database needs a Database admin or Database administrator to manage the stored data.|There is no administrator in Blockchain.|
|The administrator has authority over it from a central location. Any change in the data can cause the information to change all over the place. Anyone with access to the centralized database can corrupt or destroy the data. It has resulted in hacking and forgery cases.|Modifying data does not require permission.  Users have a copy of data and by modifying the copies does not affect the master copy of the data as Blockchain is irresistible to modification of data.|
|Centralized databases keep information that is up-to-date at a particular moment.|Blockchain keeps the present information as well as the past information that has been stored before.|
|Centralized databases are used as databases for a really long time and have a good performance record, but are slow for ertain functionalities.|Blockchain is ideal for transaction platform but it slows down when used as databases, specially with large collection of data.|
|Blockchain technology faces scalability issues because of its dependency on all the decentralized nodes.|Because permissions are centralized and the powers to alter data are in the hands of a few, traditional databases can handle enormous volumes of transactions per second. The client-server design lowers reliance on nodes, which are replaced with isolated server centers.|
|Blockchain has the potential to boost data transparency and trust, resulting in increased creativity, productivity, and quality.|Traditional databases fail to provide the level of transparency offered by BlockchainBlockchain.|
|As Blockchain is a public distributed ledger, it can not be customized by an individual’s choice.|A traditional database offers numerous customization choices. Permissions, Privileges, and set-up requirements can all be optimized because traditional databases are managed centrally. Developers can update the front end and add plugins to the database to make it customer-centric.|
|user only can contribute more data in the additional blocks in the Blockchain. The old data will not be destroyed; it will stay in the system and be accessible to the public.	|The client performs four action in a typical database: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four steps in the CRUD process.|
|The information that is current and the information that was previously available coexist. It generates a database with its histories in it. This property of Blockchain makes it handy for tracing records and determining a product’s validity.	|The information in a centralized or traditional database is current at any given time. If want to check old data need to found the history backup, and it also may incomplete.|
