# Blockchain History and Evolution

## 1991  
Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, they want to found the solution of the time-stamping the digital documents. Avoid the data couldn’t be tempered or misdated through chain to cryptographically secure blocks . In order to protect the integrity of past information.    


## 1992  
 Merkle Trees formed a legal corporation by using a system developed by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta with some more features. Hence, Blockchain Technology became efficient to store several documents to be collected into one block. Merkle used a Secured Chain of Blocks that stores multiple data records in a sequence.  


## 2004  
In the year 2004, Cryptographic activist Hal Finney introduced a system for digital cash known as “Reusable Proof of Work”. This step was the game-changer in the history of Blockchain and Cryptography. This System helps others to solve the Double Spending Problem by keeping the ownership of tokens registered on a trusted server.    


## 2008  
Satoshi Nakamoto conceptualized the concept of “Distributed Blockchain” in his white paper: ”A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System”.  He used a hash cash PoW (Proof-of-Work) algorithm with software-based computing functions. Introducing the concept of cryptocurrency and blockchain and helped develop the first Bitcoin software. System that is more secure and contains the secure history of data exchange.  

Blockchain infrastructure, according to the white paper, would support secure, P2P transactions without the need for trusted third parties such as banks or governments.  

Moreover, bitcoin introduces the concept of mining coins. It also ensures verifying the transactions among the decentralized nodes in the network.  


## 2009  
Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin block, validating the blockchain concept. The block contained 50 bitcoin and was known as the Genesis block -- aka block 0. The first Bitcoin transaction took place when Nakamoto sent Hal Finney 10 bitcoin in block 170.   

On Oct 31, 2009, the Bitcoin exchange marketplace launched publicly to trade bitcoins for actual money. Furthermore, Nakamoto established the Bitcoin Talk Forum to broadcast news and information.  


## 2014  
Blockchain technology is separated from the currency and Blockchain 2.0 is born. Financial institutions and other industries began to recognize and explore blockchain's potential, shifting their focus from digital currency to the development of blockchain technologies.  

The Ethereum Foundation got established by Vitalik Buterin. Ethereum paved the way for blockchain technology to be used for applications other than cryptocurrency. It introduced smart contracts and provided developers with a platform for building decentralized applications.  


## 2015  
The Ethereum Frontier network launched, enabling developers to write smart contracts and decentralized apps that could be deployed to a live network. Ethereum was on its way to becoming one of the biggest applications of blockchain technology. It drew in an active developer community that continues to this day.   


## 2016  
The word Blockchain is accepted as a single word instead of two different concepts as they were in Nakamoto’s original paper. The same year, a bug in the Ethereum DAO code was exploited resulting in a hard fork of the Ethereum Network. The Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange was hacked and nearly 120,000 bitcoin were stolen -- a bounty worth about $66 million.  


## 2017  
Japan recognized Bitcoin as a legal currency.  In the same year, bitcoin hit a record high of nearly $20,000. Seven European banks formed the Digital Trade Chain Consortium to develop a trade finance platform based on blockchain. The Block.one software company introduced the EOS blockchain operating system, based on the EOS cryptocurrency and designed to support commercial decentralized applications. About 15% of global banks used blockchain technology in some capacity.  


## 2018  
Bitcoin turned 10 in the year 2018. Reaching the value of $3,800 at the end of the year. Major tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Twitter banned cryptocurrency advertisements.  
As of good news, European Commission established the Blockchain Observatory and Forum.  
Baidu introduced its blockchain-as-a-service platform.  


## 2019  
Ethereum network transactions exceeded 1 million per day.  
Amazon announced the general availability of its Amazon Managed Blockchain service on AWS to help users build resilient Web 3.0 applications on public and private blockchains.   
Blockchain research and development took center stage as organizations embraced blockchain technology and decentralized applications for a variety of use cases.  


## 2020  
Ethereum announced the building of Ethereum 2.0.  
Interest increased in combining blockchain with AI to optimize business processes.  
Stablecoins, whose value is tied to another asset class, rose significantly because they promised more stability than traditional cybercurrencies.   


## 2021  
Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021.   
El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as a legal currency.    
Interest in using blockchain for applications other than cryptocurrency continued as governments and enterprises considered blockchain for a variety of use cases, including voting, real estate, fitness tracking, intellectual rights, IoT and vaccine distribution in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.   
An intersection of Blockchain, AR/VR, and web3 gave rise to Metaverse. Several start-ups inspired by covid -19 pandemic work from home culture started working on virtual world creation.  
The idea of web3 promoted worldwide.  

## 2022  
Ethereum has shifted from Proof of Work(PoW) to Proof of Stake(PoS) consensus mechanism. The original Ethereum mainnet merged with Beacon Chain which has Proof-of-Stake. Now it is existing as one chain. Ethereum’s energy consumption has reduced by ~99.95%.  

The ongoing year 2022 started with more fame towards NFTs and Metaverse. That eventually led to more trading options and earning opportunities. Several rich apparel companies like Nike, Adidas, Walmart, Puma, Gucci, Ferrari, and even Disney got on metaverse to create and promote their product NFT designs for avatars.  

However, various other blockchain use cases are being explored, tested, and released. Such as smart contracts for satellite communications in Space, use of Blockchain in Supply chain, Entertainment, Healthcare, Transporation, Real-estate, Automation, and many more industries.   


## 2023  
Businesses are still moving ahead with blockchain, but they're proceeding with greater caution. While blockchain technology has been mostly applicable to finance services and banking, other viable applications include gaming, media and entertainment, real estate, healthcare, cybersecurity, smart contracts, NFTs, IoT, transportation, supply chain management and the government.   

But the latest iteration of the internet, Web 3.0, with its offer of decentralization and data security, may well be the greatest driver of blockchain technology.
