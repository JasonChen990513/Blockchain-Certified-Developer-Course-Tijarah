# What is Web2
Characterized by dynamic and interactive websites that revolutionized the way we connect and collaborate online. Such as the social media. User can create, share and interact with the content. But the data and power are handle by few big company. So there the problem of the data privacy, censorship, and the concentration of power. 

# What is web3
The embodiment of a decentralized and user-centric internet. Built on blockchain technology, Web 3.0 try to build the decentralized structures. Each participant has a say and can contribute to the collective decision-making process. In web3, the own their creation, buy and sell digital and real world assets. 

# The need for web3
It provide more secure, private, transparnecy of transaction. And it is no need the intermediary.

# Main ideas behind Web3
## Decentralization   
‍
>Web3 is built upon the concept of decentralization, where power is distributed among participants rather than controlled by a central authority.   
>It's peer-to-peer network, where user can interact directly with each other without the need for intermediaries or a centralized server.  

## Verifiability    
‍
>Web3 leverages blockchain to provide transparency and verifiability.   
>Transactions and interactions can be recorded on a public ledger, enabling anyone to independently verify the authenticity and integrity of data.   

## Trustless   
‍
>Trust is not placed solely in central authorities or intermediaries.   
>Trust is base on the cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms.   

## Self governance    
‍
>Communities collectively make decisions and govern the platforms and protocols they use.   
>Through decentralized governance mechanisms, such as token-based voting or consensus-based decision-making, users have a say in the direction and rules of the system.   

## Permissionless   
‍
>Anyone can participate, no need any apply or invite.   
>Allow any individuals to freely engage with the ecosystem.  

## Ownership  
‍
>In Web2, we have relied on banks to hold our money; on Visa, SWIFT, Paypal and others to transact our money; and on Google, Facebook and others to verify our identity. In Web3, our >wallet (and the assets within it) can be used to verify our decentralized identity and as the “key” to unlock verification and commerce.  ‍  

## Native payments   
‍
>Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Algorand, play a significant role in Web3, enabling direct and seamless transactions. This also allows for payments to bypass traditional financial intermediaries and reduce transaction fees.

## Token economy:   
Web3 introduces a token economy where digital assets can hold real value and be used for payments and transactions within the ecosystem, so payments can be made peer-to-peer in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.   

## Governance: 
Web3 promotes community-driven DAO governance, where decisions are made collectively by participants through voting and consensus mechanisms.  
‍
## Identity:   
Web3 introduces digital identity solutions that allow users to have portable identities that can be used across various decentralized applications (DApps), allowing users to transfer and manage identity credentials within the Web3 ecosystem.  

## Native built-in payments:   
Web3 platforms have native payment capabilities, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries like banks or payment processors. Users can make direct and secure payments using digital currencies within the ecosystem.

## What is the biggest difference between Web2 and Web3?

The biggest difference between Web2 and Web3 is the shift from a centralized internet to a decentralized one.   
Web2 relies on intermediaries and centralized platforms.   
Web3 enables peer-to-peer interactions without the need for intermediaries, offering more control and ownership to users.   

## Is Web3 replacing Web2? 

Web3 is not replacing Web2 entirely. Instead, it represents the next evolution of the internet.    
Web3 is introducing new technologies and approaches to the internet as we currently know it.    
Web3 challenges the dominance of centralized platforms through decentralized applications (dApps) running on the blockchain.   

## Why is Web3 better than Web2? 

It provides more data ownership and control for individuals, eliminating the reliance on centralized authorities and reducing the risk of data misuse.    
Additionally, Web3 fosters transparency, trust, and democratization of the internet by leveraging distributed ledger technologies and allowing anyone to participate without monetizing their personal information.   



## Question:

### Dapp using the blockchain to store the data. How it work?   
After the smart contract execute, the data will be store in to the block, and everyone can see that.

### How decentralized app work?    
Decentralized Network: DApps run on a decentralized network of nodes (computers) that participate in a blockchain or peer-to-peer network. These nodes work together to validate transactions and execute smart contracts.  

Smart Contracts: DApps often make use of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with the terms of the contract directly written into code. These contracts automatically execute actions when predefined conditions are met.  

Data Storage: DApps may use blockchain technology for data storage, ensuring data immutability and transparency. This data is stored in a distributed ledger, accessible to all participants in the network.  

User Interface: DApps have a user interface (UI) that can be web-based or a standalone application. Users interact with the DApp through this interface to perform various functions, such as making transactions or interacting with smart contracts.  

Token Usage: Many DApps have their own native tokens or cryptocurrencies that are used within the application for various purposes, such as paying for services, participating in governance, or staking for network security.  

Consensus Mechanism: DApps rely on a consensus mechanism (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) to validate and confirm transactions. This mechanism ensures the security and integrity of the network.  

Decentralized Governance: Some DApps incorporate decentralized governance models, allowing users to participate in decision-making processes and protocol upgrades.  

### How to using blockchain techology on the game filed?  
Smart Contracts: The game is built using smart contracts, self-executing code deployed on a blockchain. These smart contracts define the game's rules, mechanics, and token standards. They handle everything from character creation and asset ownership to in-game actions and rewards. Like the server in the cetralized system.

Data Storage on the Blockchain: In blockchain games, various types of data are stored directly on the blockchain. This includes player profiles, in-game assets (represented as NFTs or tokens), transaction history, and game state. Smart contracts on the blockchain define and manage this data.

Disadvantage:
Access Complexity: Accessing data from the blockchain can be more complex compared to centralized databases. Users typically need to use blockchain wallets or interfaces that support the specific blockchain network the game is built on. They may also require some knowledge of blockchain technology.

Scalability: Blockchain networks often face scalability issues in handling a large number of transactions simultaneously. Real-time games like LoL and Apex require rapid and frequent interactions, such as character movements, actions, and updates. Blockchain transactions may not be able to match the real-time responsiveness needed for such games.

Latency: Blockchain transactions can introduce latency due to the time required for transaction confirmation and block generation. Real-time games demand low latency to ensure smooth gameplay. Blockchain networks can't always guarantee the sub-second response times needed for these games.

Game State: Storing the entire game state on the blockchain would be impractical due to storage limitations and data costs. While some game elements, like in-game assets, can be represented as NFTs on the blockchain, core game state and mechanics typically remain off-chain to ensure efficient gameplay.

Transaction Costs: Real-time games could generate a significant number of transactions, each incurring transaction fees. These fees could make the cost of playing the game prohibitive.
