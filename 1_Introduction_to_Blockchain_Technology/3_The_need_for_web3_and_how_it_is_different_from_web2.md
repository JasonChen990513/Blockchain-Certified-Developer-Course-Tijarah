# What is Web2
Characterized by dynamic and interactive websites that revolutionized the way we connect and collaborate online. Such as the social media. User can create, share and interact with the content. But the data and power are handle by few big company. So there the problem of the data privacy, censorship, and the concentration of power. 

# What is web3
The embodiment of a decentralized and user-centric internet. Built on blockchain technology, Web 3.0 try to build the decentralized structures. Each participant has a say and can contribute to the collective decision-making process. In web3, the own their creation, buy and sell digital and real world assets. 

# The need for web3
It provide more secure, private, transparnecy of transaction. And it is no need the intermediary.

# Main ideas behind Web3
## Decentralization   
‍
>Web3 is built upon the concept of decentralization, where power is distributed among participants rather than controlled by a central authority.   
>It's peer-to-peer network, where user can interact directly with each other without the need for intermediaries or a centralized server.  

## Verifiability    
‍
>Web3 leverages blockchain to provide transparency and verifiability.   
>Transactions and interactions can be recorded on a public ledger, enabling anyone to independently verify the authenticity and integrity of data.   

## Trustless   
‍
>Trust is not placed solely in central authorities or intermediaries.   
>Trust is base on the cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms.   

## Self governance    
‍
>Communities collectively make decisions and govern the platforms and protocols they use.   
>Through decentralized governance mechanisms, such as token-based voting or consensus-based decision-making, users have a say in the direction and rules of the system.   

## Permissionless   
‍
>Anyone can participate, no need any apply or invite.   
>Allow any individuals to freely engage with the ecosystem.  

## Ownership  
‍
>In Web2, we have relied on banks to hold our money; on Visa, SWIFT, Paypal and others to transact our money; and on Google, Facebook and others to verify our identity. In Web3, our >wallet (and the assets within it) can be used to verify our decentralized identity and as the “key” to unlock verification and commerce.  ‍  

## Native payments   
‍
>Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Algorand, play a significant role in Web3, enabling direct and seamless transactions. This also allows for payments to bypass traditional financial intermediaries and reduce transaction fees.  




# Key feature of Web3

## Technology:  
leveraging Web3 decentralized and transparent nature to enable trustless interactions and smart contract execution.  

## Ownership & sovereignty:   
Web3 shifts the power balance by giving users ownership and control over their data, allowing individuals to decide how their information is used.  

## Censorship resistance:  
Web3's decentralized nature makes it resistant to censorship, such as social media networks build in web3 ,that can’t arbitrarily ban or censor users like in the way that centralized platforms can.  

## Greater privacy and security:    
With enhanced privacy and security measures, Web3 can reduce the need to share personal data with third parties in order to access services and applications. Users have more control over their personal information and can maintain a higher level of privacy.  

## Token economy:   
Web3 introduces a token economy where digital assets can hold real value and be used for payments and transactions within the ecosystem, so payments can be made peer-to-peer in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.   

## Governance: 
Web3 promotes community-driven DAO governance, where decisions are made collectively by participants through voting and consensus mechanisms.  
‍
## Identity:   
Web3 introduces digital identity solutions that allow users to have portable identities that can be used across various decentralized applications (DApps), allowing users to transfer and manage identity credentials within the Web3 ecosystem.  

## Native built-in payments:   
Web3 platforms have native payment capabilities, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries like banks or payment processors. Users can make direct and secure payments using digital currencies within the ecosystem.  


# Web3 vs Web2


| Web2| Web3 |
|:-------------------|:------------------|
|Controlled by large, centralized companies|Controlled and governed by communities|
|Limited control over you data|Onwership and control over your data.|
|Reliance on third parties for transactions and interactions|Direct peer-to-peer interactions without intermediaries|
|Lack of transparency in data handling and decision-making|Transparent, open source, and democratic|
|Innovation driven by a few major players|Open ecosystem fostering widespread innovation| 
|Trust placed in large corporations|Trust built into technology through cryptography and consensus mechanisms|
|Ownership verification provided by large corporations|Ownership self-custodied and verified by users|
|Centralized payment systems and intermediaries|Native digital currency payments with reduced intermediaries and fees|
|Vulnerable to censorship and content control|Resistant to censorship due to decentralization|
|Limited privacy control and potential data exploitation|Enhanced privacy control through cryptographic techniques|
|Limited scalability with growing user base|Scalability potential through blockchain technology|



## What is the biggest difference between Web2 and Web3?

The biggest difference between Web2 and Web3 is the shift from a centralized internet to a decentralized one.   
Web2 relies on intermediaries and centralized platforms.   
Web3 enables peer-to-peer interactions without the need for intermediaries, offering more control and ownership to users.   

## Is Web3 replacing Web2? 

Web3 is not replacing Web2 entirely. Instead, it represents the next evolution of the internet.    
Web3 is introducing new technologies and approaches to the internet as we currently know it.    
Web3 challenges the dominance of centralized platforms through decentralized applications (dApps) running on the blockchain.   

## Why is Web3 better than Web2? 

It provides more data ownership and control for individuals, eliminating the reliance on centralized authorities and reducing the risk of data misuse.    
Additionally, Web3 fosters transparency, trust, and democratization of the internet by leveraging distributed ledger technologies and allowing anyone to participate without monetizing their personal information.
