## what is block?
Blocks are data structures within the blockchain database. Transaction data will be store in to the block and is immutable.  
Block record the transactions not yet validated by the network. Once the data are validated, the block is close. And create another one to store new data.  
A block is thus a permanent store of records that, once written, cannot be altered or removed.  
A block is a place in a blockchain where information is stored and encrypted.  
Blocks are identified by long numbers that include encrypted transaction information from previous blocks and new transaction information.  
Blocks and the information within them must be verified by a network before new blocks can be created.
