# Block
## what is block?
Blocks are data structures within the blockchain database. Transaction data will be store in to the block and is immutable.  
Block record the transactions not yet validated by the network. Once the data are validated, the block is close. And create another one to store new data.  
A block is thus a permanent store of records that, once written, cannot be altered or removed.  
A block is a place in a blockchain where information is stored and encrypted.  
Blocks are identified by long numbers that include encrypted transaction information from previous blocks and new transaction information.  
Blocks and the information within them must be verified by a network before new blocks can be created.

## What is transaction
A transaction refers to a contract, agreement, transfer, or exchange of assets between two or more parties. The asset is typically cash or property. Likewise, a blockchain transaction is nothing but data transmission across the network of computers in a blockchain system.  
### Transaction hash
A unique identifier generated for each transaction that occurs on the network. It is a long string of characters and numbers that serves as a digital fingerprint for a specific transaction. The transaction hash is crucial for tracking and verifying transactions on the blockchain.  
### Block No
It is a unique identifier assigned to each block in the blockchain.   
Each block contains a collection of transactions and is linked to the previous block through a cryptographic hash, forming a chain of blocks.   
The block number helps organize and sequence the blocks within the blockchain.  
### Wallet
Wallet is a digital tool that allows users to store, manage, and interact with their cryptocurrencies.   
It doesn't actually "store" the cryptocurrencies themselves but securely stores the cryptographic keys (private and public keys) needed to access and manage the funds associated with a blockchain address.  
### Gas
Gas measures the computational work required to execute operations or smart contracts on a blockchain.  
When executing smart contracts, each operation within the contract consumes a specific amount of gas.   
More complex operations or computations require more gas.  
Gas serves as a mechanism to prevent abuse of network resources. Encourages efficient use of network resources.  
### Block confirmation 
Process of validating and adding a block of transactions to the blockchain. 
When a new block is created and added to the blockchain, it undergoes a confirmation process to ensure that the transactions within the block are legitimate and secure.

## What is decentralization network
Decentralized networks strive to reduce the level of trust that participants must place in one another, and deter their ability to exert authority or control over one another in ways that degrade the functionality of the network.
