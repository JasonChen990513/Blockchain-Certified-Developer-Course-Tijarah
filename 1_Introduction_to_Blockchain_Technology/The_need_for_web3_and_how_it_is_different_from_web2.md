# What is Web2
Characterized by dynamic and interactive websites that revolutionized the way we connect and collaborate online. Such as the social media. User can create, share and interact with the content. But the data and power are handle by few big company. So there the problem of the data privacy, censorship, and the concentration of power. 

# What is web3
The embodiment of a decentralized and user-centric internet. Built on blockchain technology, Web 3.0 try to build the decentralized structures. Each participant has a say and can contribute to the collective decision-making process. In web3, the own their creation, buy and sell digital and real world assets. 

# The need for web3
It provide more secure, private, transparnecy of transaction. And it is no need the intermediary.

## Main ideas behind Web3
Decentralization   
‍
>Web3 is built upon the concept of decentralization, where power is distributed among participants rather than controlled by a central authority.   
>It's peer-to-peer network, where user can interact directly with each other without the need for intermediaries or a centralized server.  

Verifiability    
‍
>Web3 leverages blockchain to provide transparency and verifiability.   
>Transactions and interactions can be recorded on a public ledger, enabling anyone to independently verify the authenticity and integrity of data.   

Trustless   
‍
>Trust is not placed solely in central authorities or intermediaries.   
>Trust is base on the cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms.   

Self governance    
‍
>Communities collectively make decisions and govern the platforms and protocols they use.   
>Through decentralized governance mechanisms, such as token-based voting or consensus-based decision-making, users have a say in the direction and rules of the system.   

Permissionless   
‍
>Anyone can participate, no need any apply or invite.   
>Allow any individuals to freely engage with the ecosystem.  

Ownership  
‍
>In Web2, we have relied on banks to hold our money; on Visa, SWIFT, Paypal and others to transact our money; and on Google, Facebook and others to verify our identity. In Web3, our >wallet (and the assets within it) can be used to verify our decentralized identity and as the “key” to unlock verification and commerce.  ‍  

Native payments   
‍
>Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Algorand, play a significant role in Web3, enabling direct and seamless transactions. This also allows for payments to bypass traditional financial intermediaries and reduce transaction fees.  




## Web3 vs Web2


| Web2| Web3 |
|:-------------------|:------------------|
|Controlled by large, centralized companies|Controlled and governed by communities|
|Limited control over you data|Onwership and control over your data.|
|Reliance on third parties for transactions and interactions|Direct peer-to-peer interactions without intermediaries|
|Lack of transparency in data handling and decision-making|Transparent, open source, and democratic|
|Innovation driven by a few major players|Open ecosystem fostering widespread innovation| 
|Trust placed in large corporations|Trust built into technology through cryptography and consensus mechanisms|
|Ownership verification provided by large corporations|Ownership self-custodied and verified by users|
|Centralized payment systems and intermediaries|Native digital currency payments with reduced intermediaries and fees|
|Vulnerable to censorship and content control|Resistant to censorship due to decentralization|
|Limited privacy control and potential data exploitation|Enhanced privacy control through cryptographic techniques|
|Limited scalability with growing user base|Scalability potential through blockchain technology|
