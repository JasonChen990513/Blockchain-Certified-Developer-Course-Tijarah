## Video name: Types of Blockchain Explained | Blockchain Types
1.Public Blockchain
>Public accessible, permissionless.  
>No restriction on the participant and validator.  
>Uncontrollability: single entuty can complete control over this network.  
>Data is secure and help in immutability.  
>Everyone have equal, so it is fully distributed.  
>>EX: Bitcoin and ethereum.   

Question: The developer can do some change for the blockchain? if can, what is the meaning of the complete control?  

2.Private Blockchain  
>Invitation is required. Resrict the people who can participate.  
>Only the user who in this system can see the transcation.  
>Centralized and much better control.   
>Governed and regulated by someone.   
>Can have token or not, it is based on the owner.  
>>EX: Hyperledger Fabric  



3.Consorttium/Hybird  
>Some nodes private.  
>Other are public.  
>Some node use to participate the transcation, and other node use to control consensus process.  
>All node can access by blockchain, and what information can be accessed is based on particular data in that blockchain.  
>There are two type of the users, one is only can access the blockchain as their function, another can control over the blockchain and decides the level of security.  

Difference between Blockchain and cryptocurrency  
>The relationship between Blockchain and cryptocurrency like the mobile app and mobile OS, like the bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency on the blockchain platform.

Info of public vs private blockchain and scalability of blockchain

            Public don't use consensus algorithm, private blockchain can use consensus algorithm such as Poorf of Elapsed Time(PoET), Raft and Istanbul BFT. (Question : Why don't use in public blockchain? XX)
            IBFT

            (Quesiton: 
            Transactions per second (or TPS) are lesser in a public blockchain when compared to private blockchains.  
            As the number of authorized participants is less in a private blockchain, it can process hundreds or even thousands of transactions per second. why?)

            Public blockchain more scalable. Private blockchain less scalable.
            (Question: 
            public blockchain cannot compete with a private blockchain in terms of scalability  issues as it is slow and hence can process transactions only at a slow pace. 

            In a private blockchain, as only a few nodes need to manage data, transactions can be  supported and processed at a much higher pace.

            What is the meaning of scalability at here?)

            Public blockchain is trustless network. In private blockchain, participants must not trust one another.
            (Question: why can not trust other perticipants in private blockchain? 
             Answer:　Because in a private blockchain, the validity of records cannot be independently verified as the integrity of a private network relies on the credibility of the authorized nodes.)

            Public Blockchain is more secure and private blockchain is less secure. 
            Because the node of the blockchain in public blockchain is higher than private blockchain, so the hacker hard to modify the data in blockchain. And hacker can hack whole network through accessing central node.

            Public blockchain consumes more energy and private blockchain consumes less.

            Public bloclchain have riskier it terms of collision or 51% attack. Private blockchain no chance of minor collisions.
               In the private blockchain, there is no chance of minor collision, because the validator in the network is know and they have suitable credentials.
               In public blockchain, the validator don't know each other, so it increase the risk of the potential collision (Current cryptographic hash function used in blockchain. Although incredibly unlikely, the possibility still exists potential threat to the data integrity).

               And it also have change to be 51% attack (where a group of miners who control more than 50% of the  network’s computing power can influence it).
