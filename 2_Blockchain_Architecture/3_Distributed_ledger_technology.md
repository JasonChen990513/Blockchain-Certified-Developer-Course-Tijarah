# What is Distributed Ledger Technology?
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a broad category of technologies and systems that enable the decentralized and distributed recording of information across a network of participants.   
At its core, DLT is a type of database that is spread across multiple nodes or locations, and each participant in the network has a copy of the entire database.   
Changes to the database are made through consensus mechanisms, ensuring that all participants agree on the state of the ledger.  

## Decentralization
All participants in the network have equal access and control over the ledger.  
Eliminating the need for a central authority or intermediary.  
## Distributed Consensus
Through consensus mechanism to ensure the data is correct before added to the ledger.   
## Immutability
Once data is added to the ledger and consensus is reached, it becomes very difficult to alter or tamper with the information.     
## Transparency
Participants in this network can view all transaction histry record.  
This transparency can foster trust among participants.  
## Smart Contracts
Smart contract is self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.  
When the condition is triggered, the code will automatically execute the smart contracts.  
## Security
Due to the distributed nature of the ledger and cryptographic techniques, so the DLT is more resistant to hacking or unauthorized alterations.


## Video Name: Difference Between Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology

Blockchain is one type of distributed ledger.  
Blockchain is the subset of distributed ledger.  
Distributed ledger do not need proof of work. Better scaling option. It have mutiple sites, regions or Participants.  






## Question:
when the system check the data consistency?  
>Before the block put into blockchain.
