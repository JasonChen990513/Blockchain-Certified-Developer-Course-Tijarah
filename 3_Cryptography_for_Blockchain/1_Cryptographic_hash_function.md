# What Are Cryptographic Hash Functions?
Cryptographic hash function is the mathematical function that use in cryptography.   
The hash function transform or "map" a given input data set into a bit string of fixed size, also known as the "hash value."  
A cryptographic hash function combines the message-passing capabilities of hash functions with security properties.

# How Cryptographic Hash Functions Work
Hash function are usually use to check the integrity of messages and authenticating information.
While they are considered cryptographically "weak" because they can be solved in polynomial time, they are not easily decipherable.

Cryptographic hash functions add security features to typical hash functions, making it more difficult to detect the contents of a message or information about recipients and senders.
